# Invers

---

### Invers is a reverse proxy, load balancer, and web server written in Rust.

I made Invers to learn low-level programming with Rust and to implement a http server from scratch. I'm also using it as a personal project to learn more about how reverse proxies, load balancers and web servers work under the hood.

Routing is yet to be implemented, but you can use Invers as a simple reverse proxy for now.


#### Features:
- Reverse proxy: Invers can proxy incoming requests to one or more backend servers based on configurable rules.
- Load balancing: Invers can distribute incoming requests among multiple backend servers, improving performance and reliability. (TODO)
- Web server: Invers can serve static content and act as a standalone web server if needed. (TODO)
